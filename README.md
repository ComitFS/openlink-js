# Globility implementation of Openlink library for Strophe.js

##Description

This application uses [Strophe.js](https://github.com/strophe/strophejs) to provide an implementation of the [Openlink XMPP API](http://openlink.4ng.net:8080/openlink/xep-xxx-openlink_15-11.xml).

##Getting started

If you havenâ€™t already done so, install Node.js and NPM. You also need to install the Grunt command line interface by running 
`npm install -g grunt-cli`. This allows you to run the grunt command from anywhere on your system.

Run `npm install` in your console to install the dependencies.

Run `grunt build` to compile the assets into `build/`.

Run `grunt watch` to auto compile the assets into `build/` as changes are made to `assets/`.

##Components

The OpenlinkJS library found in `strophe.openlink.js` is a plugin for the [Strophe.js](https://github.com/strophe/strophejs) library.

More information about Strophe.js plugins can be found [here](http://professionalxmpp.com/profxmpp_ch14.pdf). But the short 
summary is to simply drop the file `strophe.openlink.js` alongside the `strophe.js` lib into your web application.
 
The `strophe.openlink.js` library can from thereon be referenced to simply by calling the `Strophe.Connection` object with 
`connection.openlink`.



Please refer to `index.html` to view an example of the application within a page.

The items required to use the application can all be found in the `build` folder.

* Any image assets in `img` need to be correctly referenced in the CSS and index.html files relative to your environment.
* stylesheet - `application.css`.
* Everything between `<!-- Application -->`. This includes:
    * javascript - `application.js`.
    * init script which stars the application - `App.start({...});`
